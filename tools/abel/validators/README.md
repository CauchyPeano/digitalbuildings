# ABEL Spreadsheet

### Overview
The ABEL Spreadsheet serves as a frontend for the ABEL application. The
spreadsheet is the human-friendly interface that allows users to make changes to
a Building Configuration file.

## Google Sheets template
Since the format of an ABEL spreadsheet is well-defined, it is suggested that
you use the following [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qKMlpJI5-_h_8innNniEkpatMBcRHSGekrRwTsPQ618/copy#gid=980240783) as either your input or output spreadsheet.

### Site

The `Site` sheet is the sheet that holds all information about a project site or
building.

**Building Code** - The human readable code for a building.
  e.g. `US-SVL-TC2`

**GUID** - UUID4 value for a building
  **Note:** Unless you are onboarding a Google building, this value is generated by ABEL and does not need to be provided for
  initial onboarding.

**Note:** A Site should not be considered an entity and should not be listed in
the `Entities` sheet.
