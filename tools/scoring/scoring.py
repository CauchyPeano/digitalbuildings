# Inputs/Output
# The tool should accept four sets of files, specified at the command line:
# Digital Building Ontology Ontology files (from github)
# Known good Building Configuration file
# Building Configuration to be scored
# Local type additions to DBO (in YAML, similar to the ontology)
# The tool must produce a matrix of scores along the dimensions described in scoring detail.  Output should be trivially importable into Google Sheets.
# Integration
# The new functionality should take advantage of existing code for reading and validating inputs wherever possible.
