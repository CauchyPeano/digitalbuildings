# Instance Validator

The Instance Validator allows you to create YAML instance files and validate them to make sure they comform to the given ontology.

## Usage
The Instance Validator is written in Python3 and takes as a CLI argument the path pointing to the instance files.

The validator can be run as following: `python3 main.py path/to/test_file.yaml`

Note: as of the current development stage, you must clone the entire repository and run this instance validator script from this directory.
